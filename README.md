## Hi there 👋

I'm Cosmin James and I use coding to shape my ideas. <br/>
I believe deleted code is debugged code.

### I'm working on:
* ⚙️ &nbsp; VME - Visual Makefile Editor. Draw visual blueprints for the GNU `make` utility (and more!)
* 💠 &nbsp; rendeer - 3D rendering engine for Python.

### I'm currently learning:
* x86 Assembly
* Web Development
* Linux Server Administration

### More about me...
I've been learning for the past 16 years. <br/>
Ask me about any of my projects. Talk to me about yours! If I can't lend a hand, I might give you a tip. I'm open to collaboration - just send me a message.

### Contact me
My personal e-mail address is <cosminjames555@gmail.com>. Feel free to contact me, but I probably won't answer instantly.
