## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cosmin James, and I like to write software (and, of course, design, document, build, debug, test, fix it!).

### More about me...
Ask me about any of my projects. Talk to me about yours! If I can't lend a hand, I might give you a tip. I'm open to collaboration - just send me a message.

### Contact me
My personal e-mail address is <cosminjames555@gmail.com>. Feel free to contact me, but I probably won't answer instantly.
